# Constructor

- Method use to initialize an object;
- new key word is used to create an object;
- Allowed modifiers are public, protected, private, <default>
- For any class, if we are allowed to create a single object, such type of class is called a **singleton class**. (use modifiers as private for contructor)
- Access modifier of default constructor is same as access modifier of class, rule only applicable to public and default.
- The first line of constructor must be super(); or this;
- You can use super() and this() only to constructor;
- this() -> used to call current class constructor;
- super() -> used to call parent class / super class constructor;
- this -> used to call current class instance variable;
- super -> used to call parent class instance variable;
