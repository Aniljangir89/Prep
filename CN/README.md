- **Network:**
  A network is a set of devices connected by communication meduim.
- **Computer Network:** A computer network is a system that connects multiple devicesâ€”like computers, servers, or smartphonesâ€”so they can communicate, share data, and resources efficiently. It is the backbone of the digital world. Every time you send a WhatsApp message, stream Netflix, or make a UPI payment, youâ€™re using a computer network.
- **Data Communications:**
  exchange of data between two
  devices via transmission medium.

> ### Five Components of Data Communication

1. Message
2. Sender
3. Receiver
4. Medium
5. Protocol

- **Protocol:** A protocol is set of rules that govern data communications. It is like an agreement between communicating devices.
  Without a protocol, two devices may
  be connected but cannot communicate, just like a person cannot understand
  Assamese who speaks only Tamil

> ### During data communication, data flow is of 3 type:

</p>
  
- type of connection between them : point to point, multipoint

| Connection Type | Description                                                                  | Real-life Example                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Point-to-Point  | Entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between two devices | Telephone call between two people            |
| Multipoint      | More than two devices share a common link                                    | Classroom with one teacher and many students |

> ### Goals of the network

1. Performance
2. Reliability
3. Security

- **Physical Topology**: The term physical topology refers to the way in which a network is laid
  out physically.

<p align="center">

</p>

- **Mesh Topology**  
  Every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every other device.

- **Star Topology**
    - Each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller,
      usually called a hub.
    - If a device wants to send data to
      another device, it sends the data to
      hub, which relays the data to another
      connected device.

- **Bus Topology**
    - Bus topology uses multipoint connections.
    - Nodes are connected to the bus cable by drop lines (connection running
      between device and the main cable)and taps (connector).

- **Ring Topology**  
   Each device has a dedicated point-to
  point with only two devices on either
  side of it.

### Types of Networks

| Network Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                | Example                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Local Area Network (LAN)        | Usually privately owned and links devices in a single office, building, or campus.                                                         | Our campus network                  |
| Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) | Covers a town or a city, designed for customers who need high-speed connectivity.                                                          | Cable TV network                    |
| Wide Area Network (WAN)         | Provides long-distance transmission of data, image, audio, and video over large geographic areas (country, continent, or even the planet). | Internet backbone, telecom networks |
| Internet                        | When two or more networks (LAN, MAN, WAN) are connected, they become an internetwork or Internet.                                          | The global Internet                 |

- **ðŸ‘‰ Standard:** A set of agreed rules or guidelines made by organizations(like IEEE, ISO, ITU, ANSI) so that different devices and systems can work together

---

# <P align="center">OSI Model</P>

- ISO is the organization. OSI is the model.
- An ISO standard
  that covers all aspects ofnetwork communications is the Open Systems Interconnection
  model.

- An **open system** lets two different computers talk to each other using common rules.
  The **OSI model** explains how this communication works without changing their hardware or software.

> ### Layered Architecture of OSI Model

 <P align="center">

 </P>

- Each layer in the sending device adds its own information
  to the message it receives from the layer just above it and passes the whole package to
  the layer just below it.

> ### Physical Layer

- Main Responsibility: The physical layer is concerned with
  transmitting raw bits over a communication medium/channel.
  <P align="center">
  <img src="image-4.png" alt="alt text" />
  </P>

- It also define the type of transmission media.
- The physical layer data consists of a stream of
  bits (sequence of 0s and 1s) with no interpretation(explanation).
- **Data Rate**: The number of bits transmitted per second is also specified
  by the physical layer.
- Bit synchronization at the physical layer ensures sender and receiver agree on timing so that each bit (0 or 1) is correctly recognized. Without it, bits would get misread, causing data corruption.
- It also defines the Line configuration, Physical topology,Transmission mode.

> ### Data Link Layer

- **Main Responsibility**: It makes
  physical layer appear error-free to the network layer.

| Feature            | Hop-to-Hop Delivery                                            | End-to-End Delivery                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **OSI Layer**      | Data Link Layer                                                | Network Layer                                        |
| **Scope**          | Delivery from one node(router,switch..) to the next (one link) | Delivery from source device to destination device    |
| **Responsibility** | Ensures a frame is delivered to the next hop                   | Ensures a packet is delivered across the entire path |
| **Unit of Data**   | Frame                                                          | Packet                                               |
| **Reliability**    | Checks errors at each link (e.g., CRC)                         | Ensures packet reaches the correct destination       |
| **Example**        | PC â†’ Switch, Switch â†’ Router                                   | Client â†’ Web Server across the Internet              |

> Why Both Hop-to-Hop and End-to-End Delivery are Needed?
>
> - We need both because hop-to-hop checks each step of the journey, while end-to-end makes sure the whole message reaches the destination. Together, they keep communication reliable and complete.

- **Framing**: The data link layer divides the stream of bits received from
  the network layer into manageable data units called frames.

- **Flow control**: If the rate at which the data are absorbed by the receiver is
  less than the rate at which data are produced in the sender, the data link
  layer imposes a flow control mechanism to avoid overloading of receiver.

- A trailer is added to the end of frame for error control.
- **Access control**: When two or more devices are connected to the same link,
  data link layer protocols determine which device has control over the link at
  any given time.

> ### Network Layer

- **MainResponsibility**: The network is responsible for the source-to
  destination delivery of packet, possibly across multiple networks
  (links).

<P align="center">
 <img src="image-6.png" alt="alt text" />
 </P>

- **Logical Addressing**: If packet passes the network boundary, we need another addressing system to help
  distinguish the source and destination systems.

> Q: If the Data Link layer can deliver packets using MAC addresses, why do we need logical addressing (IP addresses) in the Network layer?
>
> - MAC addresses work only inside a local network (e.g., your laptop to a printer via a switch). But if you send data to a server in another country, the packet must cross many networks. Here, the IP address (logical address) guides routers to deliver data end-to-end, just like a full postal address across cities.

- **Routing**: When independent networks or links are connected to form internetwork
  (network of networks), the connecting devices (called routers or switches) routes or
  switch the packets to their final destination. The network layer ensures this
  mechanism for source-to-destination delivery.

> ### Transport Layer

- **Main Responsibility**: The transport layer is responsible for process-to-process delivery of the
  entire message in segments.

<P align="center">
 <img src="image-7.png" alt="alt text" />
 </P>

- **Service-point addressing**:Since computers often run multiple programs at the same time, source-to-destination delivery means not only sending data from the source computer to the destination computer, but also ensuring delivery from a specific process (running program) on one computer to the corresponding process on the other.

- **Segmentation**:
  A message is divided into transmittable segments, with each segment
  containing a sequence number.
- Transport Layer can be either connectionless and connection-oriented. is its connectionless then segments are individually sent to destination.but if its connection oriented transport layer needs to make first connection with transport layer of the destination machine before delivering data.
- **Flow Control**:like data link layer flow control does't happen at each hop, in this layer flow control heppen end-to-end.

- **Error Control**: error control perfromed process to process.

> ### Session Layer

- **Main Responsibility**: The session layer is responsible for dialog
  control and synchronization.

- **Dialog Control**:Dialog control is the function of the session layer in networking that manages who can talk, when, and for how long in a communication between two devices.
- **Synchronization**:This Layer allow to add check point to a stream of data. if a crash happens then requires to transmit only those data after the recent check point.

> ### Presentation Layer:

- **Main Responsibility**: The presentation layer is responsible for
  translation, compression and encryption.

- **Translation**: The presentation layer at the sender changes the information from its sender
  dependent format into a common format.

- **Encryption**:Encryption means that the sender transforms the original information to another
  form and sends the resulting message out over the network.

- **Compression**: Data compressing reduces the number of bits contained in
  the information.

> **Application Layer**: The application layer is responsible for
> providing services to the user.
